# Google-Scholar-Scraper
This is a one page php website to scrape google scholar and chart the number of papers each year with that phrase used in them. 

I built this because google scholar does not support that function out of the box like the main web search does.

Note that using the tool too much too frequently will get your IP address flagged as a robot request and break the tool.
